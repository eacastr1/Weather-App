# Weather-App
 
Hey! This is my weather web app made with HTML, CSS, and Java! You can open it by double-clicking on the index.html file. In order to actually use the application, you'll have to get an OpenWeather API by making an account on https://openweathermap.org/ and obtaining your API key through your settings. I did not provide my own API key because it is common practice not to share your API keys with the public (such as a GitHub repository), to prevent hacking and abuse.
